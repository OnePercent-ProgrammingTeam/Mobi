## 📌About us
Mobi originated as a collaborative endeavor within an academic setting during the third semester of the Programming II course, hosted by the Department of Management Science and Technology (DMST) at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB). This initiative was undertaken collectively by One Percent Programming Team under the mentorship and supervision of Professor [Diomidis Spinellis](https://github.com/dspinellis), who offered guidance and oversight throughout the entirety of the project.

## 💡Why Mobi?
While Mobi was born from a passion for innovation and a commitment to mastering programming skills, it possesses inherent potentials that extend beyond the classroom. With its intuitive interfaces, functionalities, and efficient Docker management capabilities, Mobi has the capacity to transition from an educational endeavor to a valuable tool in the broader software landscape.
It offers a user-friendly solution for Docker management, demonstrating its adaptability and value beyond the academic realm.
