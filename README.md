## 📌About us
Mobi originated as a collaborative endeavor within an academic setting during the third semester of the Programming II course, hosted by the Department of Management Science and Technology (DMST) at the Athens University of Economics and Business (AUEB). This initiative was undertaken collectively by One Percent Programming Team under the mentorship and supervision of Professor [Diomidis Spinellis](https://github.com/dspinellis), who offered invaluable guidance and oversight throughout the entirety of the project.
