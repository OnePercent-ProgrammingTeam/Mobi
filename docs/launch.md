```
git clone <copied_URL>
```
Replace <copied_URL> with the actual URL you copied in **Step 1**.

**Step 5:** Now, you are able to open the project in your preferred code editor or integrated development environment (IDE).<br><br> 

You are ready to proceed with the next steps of building and running our project.<br><br> 

## üî®Build the project
This section provides instructions on how to build out project. After cloning the project, follow the steps below:

**Step 1:** Open the terminal of your preferred coding environment either it is an "integrated" or a "system" terminal.

**Step 2:** Navigate to the path that includes the repository by using the "cd" command.

**Step 3:** Once you are in the correct directory, use the following command to build the project:
```

```

## ‚ñ∂Run the project
This section provides instructions on how to run our project in your preferred coding environment, whether it be a code editor or integrated development environment (IDE), allowing you to choose the version you want.<br><br>
‚ö†Ô∏è Attention: You can run the project **only after** building it.

### _CLI version_
To run the _CLI version_:\
**Step 1:** Navigate inside the path: `src/main/java/gr/aueb/dmst/onepercent/programming/cli`

**Step 2:** Click the run button of your text editor or run the command:

**OR**
Navigate inside the path: `target`and run the command:
```
java -jar mobi-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar
```
**OR**
Open File Explorer and navigate to the path that includes the repository. Heading into: `target` you will find a file named **mobi-1.0-jar-with-dependencies.jar**. By clicking on the file, you have the _GUI version_ right at your fingertips, ready to explore and interact with.

Note that for comprehensive documentation of the application, you can navigate to the generated apidocs directory.
